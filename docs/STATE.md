## Current Phase

Phase: Phase 1: Thin defect fixes
Status: On Track

## Active Stories

| Story | Status | FIS | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----|-------|
| _(none)_ | | | |

## Recently Completed

- **Initial setup** (2026-04-22): AndThen workflow structure initialized (CLAUDE.md sections, docs scaffolding, starter guidelines)

## Blockers

_(none)_

## Recent Decisions

- Adopted AndThen workflow (Project Document Index, shared guidelines, specs directory) on top of existing educational FastAPI + HTMX todo app.
- Created plan bundle `docs/specs/e2e-plan-and-implement/plan.json` with two parallel defect-fix stories: S01 for BUG-002 and S02 for BUG-003.

## Session Continuity Notes

- Keep the `Commands` and `Architecture` sections of `CLAUDE.md` intact — they serve as the Project Overview for AndThen skills.
- Authentication is **intentionally** simple (plain-text passwords, in-memory sessions). Do not "fix" without explicit direction.

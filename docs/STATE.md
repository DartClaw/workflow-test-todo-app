## Recently Completed

- **Initial setup** (2026-04-22): AndThen workflow structure initialized (CLAUDE.md sections, docs scaffolding, starter guidelines)
- **BUG-002 implemented** (2026-07-16): Updated todo edit save path to parse `due_date` as date input values so edited due dates persist after save.

## Blockers

_(none)_

## Recent Decisions

- Adopted AndThen workflow (Project Document Index, shared guidelines, specs directory) on top of existing educational FastAPI + HTMX todo app.

## Session Continuity Notes

- Keep the `Commands` and `Architecture` sections of `CLAUDE.md` intact — they serve as the Project Overview for AndThen skills.
- Authentication is **intentionally** simple (plain-text passwords, in-memory sessions). Do not "fix" without explicit direction.
